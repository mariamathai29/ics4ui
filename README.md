This was made by Allen, Sebastian, and myself, in May 2024, for our final group project for ICS4UI-- the Grade 12 Computer Science course in Ontario. 

This is a class discussion tracker for a French teacher at our school. The project has the ability to add and delete students to a class list, time how long each student spoke for, and produce statistics on how long each individual spoke, and class stats on average time spoken. 

However, some features may not work as they did in our original project. This can likely be attributed to the fact that we were only approved to use the CodeHS IDE for our project, which has some... interesting quirks. 
We also wanted to implement demographic statistics, but were restricted by time.
